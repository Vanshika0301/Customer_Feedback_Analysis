# Customer_Feedback_Analysis

AIM:

- Built a sentiment analysis tool to assess and analyze large volumes of customer feedback, and help prioritize areas for improvement for Happay.
- The same tool can be used for analyzing competitor’s customer feedback.
- Reveal insights on what Happay should focus on as well as our competitor's (Concur, Expensify etc) weakness which can lead to better marketing pitch of our product.

PROCESS:

- Build a workflow and test the prototype on various natural language processing techniques and see which performs best.
- The prototype was created using a natural language processing technique called Word2vec. It is a shallow, two-layer neural network that is trained to reconstruct linguistic contexts of words.

PROBLEMS:

- Customer Feedback Data was not available.
- Web Scraping official API’s provided limited data access and only if you are a developer of that application or owner of the product.
- Labelled positive and negative review data for training the model was not available.

SOLUTIONS:

- Web Scraping of reviews.
- Built a Dynamic Web Scraper for google play store, G2 Crowd, Apple app store and Capterra.

Two approaches:
1. Downloaded labelled data available for research purposes of various products like amazon cell phone, electronics reviews, Myntra product reviews etc and combined them to build a robust model.
2. Label dataset for 2000 travel and expense reviews manually and use them for predictions for other data which will get better with time.
